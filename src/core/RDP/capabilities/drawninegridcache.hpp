// 2.2.1.2 DrawNineGrid Cache Capability Set (TS_DRAW_NINEGRID_CAPABILITYSET)
// ==========================================================================
// The TS_DRAW_NINEGRID_CAPABILITYSET structure is used to advertise support for NineGrid
// bitmap caching and rendering (see sections 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.21, 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.22, and 2.2.2.2.1.3.4).
// This capability set is sent only from client to server.

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the capability set. This
//    field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_DRAWNINEGRIDCACHE (0x0015).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length, in bytes, of the capability
//      data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and lengthCapability fields.

// drawNineGridSupportLevel (4 bytes): A 32-bit, unsigned integer. The level of support for
//    NineGrid drawing. This field MUST be set to one of the following values.
//    +------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
//    | DRAW_NINEGRID_NO_SUPPORT     | NineGrid bitmap caching and rendering is not supported. |
